    <h1>About Thierry H. Brutman</h1>

    <p><strong>Thierry H. Brutman</strong> is the founder and CEO of <strong>EDDA Stock Invest Corp. (Chicago, USA)</strong>, a fintech research company with an affiliated entity in the United Kingdom. He is also the founder of the <strong>EDDA Stock Finance Research Laboratory (France)</strong>, an academic and applied research center that collaborates with EDDA USA to advance pioneering models at the intersection of finance, artificial intelligence, and enterprise strategy.</p>

    <p>Over the past twenty years, he has developed a unique framework unifying <em>forecasting, option theory, and cognitive AI systems</em>. His contributions include the <strong>Brutman Flexibility Index (BFI)</strong>, the <strong>Maximum Rational Investment (MRI)</strong>, and the <strong>Merchant Tracker</strong>, all of which extend beyond classical financial models to create a governed and reflexive decision architecture.</p>

    <p>His research has been presented and recognized internationally — including <strong>ICFT (Singapore, Hong Kong)</strong>, <strong>CTIS (Ordos, China)</strong>, <strong>AICCS (Oxford)</strong> — and published in leading outlets such as <strong>Wilmott Magazine</strong>. He has been invited as an <strong>official speaker at the United Nations CICPPP Committee</strong> (Geneva, 2025).</p>

    <p>Brutman’s work challenges the foundations of <strong>Real Options theory</strong>, demonstrating its structural invalidity, and proposes instead a <strong>governed signal approach</strong> (Forecast Intelligence™ and Volvas Cortex) capable of transforming enterprise strategy, monetary systems, and global financing mechanisms.</p>

    <p>His current focus is the launch of the <strong>Volvas Brain</strong>, an operational AI-as-Middleware system, integrating Forecast Intelligence with corporate governance. This innovation is designed to eliminate silos, recalibrate financial forecasts in real time, and provide enterprises and institutions with a living strategic cortex.</p>

    <p>Holding <strong>two postgraduate research diplomas</strong> in economics and in international law & strategy from leading French universities (Université Paris-Dauphine and Université de Droit, Économie et Sciences Sociales de Paris), he has built a unique interdisciplinary expertise. In 2025, he was awarded the <strong>Innovative Financial Investment Advisor of the Year</strong> (CorporateLiveWire Global Awards).</p>

    <p>Through his dual role as founder of an <strong>academic research laboratory in France</strong> and of a <strong>fintech research corporation in the USA</strong>, Thierry H. Brutman stands as one of the few researchers bridging <strong>AI, finance, and strategic policy</strong> into a coherent, operational framework — with immediate applications for enterprises, investors, and sovereigns worldwide.</p>
